## 🚀 Launching Clonify v0.4.0: Modern CLI for Flutter White-Label Apps

I'm excited to announce the release of **Clonify v0.4.0** - a powerful command-line tool that transforms how you manage multiple Flutter white-label applications! 🎉

### 🎯 What is Clonify?

Ever needed to maintain multiple versions of the same Flutter app for different clients? Each with unique branding, configurations, Firebase projects, and package names? Clonify makes this effortless.

### ✨ What's New in v0.4.0?

This release introduces a **modern Text User Interface (TUI)** that makes the CLI experience delightful:

🎯 **Interactive Prompts** - Arrow-key navigation for selections
✅ **Smart Validation** - Real-time feedback with color-coded messages
⚡ **Progress Indicators** - Track long-running operations (builds, Firebase setup)
🎨 **Colored Terminal Output** - Professional look with emoji indicators
🔄 **Backward Compatible** - Works in CI/CD with `--no-tui` flag

### 💡 Real-World Use Cases

✅ **White-Label SaaS** - One codebase, multiple branded apps
✅ **Client Projects** - Manage different client configurations
✅ **Multi-Tenant Apps** - Separate Firebase projects per tenant
✅ **A/B Testing** - Maintain multiple app variants
✅ **Regional Versions** - Different configurations per market

### 🛠️ Key Features

- 🎨 Manage unlimited app variants from a single codebase
- 🔥 Optional Firebase integration with automated project setup
- 📱 Auto-generate launcher icons and splash screens
- 📦 Smart package renaming and branding
- 🏗️ Build for Android (APK/AAB) and iOS (IPA)
- 💾 Configuration persistence and easy client switching
- 🚀 Fastlane integration for automated app store uploads

### 📦 Quick Start
